# ðŸŒ¾Crop Disease Detection Using MobileNetV2 (Deep Learning Approach)

This project aims to detect crop diseases from leaf images using a deep learning model built on MobileNetV2.  
The model is trained on the **PlantVillage Dataset** and is designed for **efficient and accurate classification** of multiple disease categories across crops like tomato, potato, and corn.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Transfer Learning** with MobileNetV2
- **Image Augmentation** to improve generalization
- **Performance Visualization** (accuracy/loss curves, confusion matrix)
- **Potential for Deployment** via Streamlit or mobile interface
